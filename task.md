## The task
Create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a collection of books.

You can find specific acceptance criteria below.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The application should have a simple and clean user interface.
2. On the main page, users should be able to view a list of all books, perform the following actions:
      * a. Add a new book
      * b. Edit an existing book
      * c. View details of a book
      * d. Delete a book
3. The books collection should be stored in a MongoDB database.
4. The application should be built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).
5. The code should be properly organized and follow best practices for maintainability and scalability.
6. The code should be submitted as a GitHub repository with clear documentation on how to run the application locally should be added in README.md.
7. Provide the GitHub repository link via email within 24 hours of receiving the task.
8. (Optional) The application should be deployed to a test server and the link to the deployed application should be provided.

## Ground rules
1. The solution should be coded in TypeScript. Styling should be done in CSS or SCSS. Your choice.
2. Put the code on your GitHub account in a public repo.
3. You don't need to add any extra features or improvements not listed in the Acceptance Criteria. There are no bonus points for it.
4. You can use other external libraries to speed up your work.
5. You can use a styling framework (Material UI, Bootstrap, or other) for quick and consistent styling.
6. If you're not able to implement all parts of the task, partial submissions are welcome.

## Tips
1. Simplicity is highly valued in this exercise.
